Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "subject": {
    "shared_token": "W4ohH-6FCupmiBdwRv_w18AToQ",
    "mail": "john.doe@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  "attributes": [{
    "name":      "eduPersonEntitlement",
    "value":     "urn:mace:aaf.edu.au:ide:researcher:1",
    "providers": [
      "urn:mace:aaf.edu.au:ide:providers:provider1",
      "urn:mace:aaf.edu.au:ide:providers:provider2"
    ]
  }]
}
```

## Modify Attributes

Add or delete attributes associated with the specified identity.

Manipulation of attributes attempts to be idempotent, in that attempting to create an attribute which already exists, or delete an attribute which does not exist will have no effect.

```
POST /api/subjects/attributes
```

### Input

| Name | Type | Description | Optional |
|---|---|---|---|
| subject | object | An object specifying the identity which will be modified by the request | No |
| provider | string | URN of the provider who will assert or modify attributes for the identity in this request | No |
| attributes | array | An array of *attribute* objects specifying the attributes which will be modified by the request | No |

#### subject
There are 3 keys way to identify a subject within an API request:

1. A subject can be identified by shared_token **only**, in which case the Subject must exist in IdE, and must have previously authenticated to IdE via the invitation system.

1. The subject can be identified by name AND mail in which case:

    1. If there is no Subject matching the provided mail attribute, one will be invited to the system. The attribute modifications specified will occur and become active after the invitation has been accepted
    1. If there is a Subject matching the provided mail attribute with an invite pending, the attribute modifications specified will occur and become active after the invitation has been accepted
    1. If there is a complete Subject matching the provided mail attribute, the attribute modifications specified will occur and become active immediately immediately

1. A shared_token, name and mail attribute is provided in the request along with the attribute *allow_create* set to true. In this case a complete Subject record will be populated and the attribute modifications specified will occur and become active immediately
