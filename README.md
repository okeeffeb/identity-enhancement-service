**Current Release:** 0.1.1-MVP (19/01/2014)

IdE enhances existing institution identities for users undertaking research activities in the Australian Higher Education sector by specifically identifying these users as a "researchers".

NeCTAR funded Virtual Laboratories (VL) and other AAF connected services will be able to use this information to make informed access control decisions specifically for researchers.

## Integration

Documentation for developers wishing to use the [IdE RESTful API is available](doc/api/v1/README.md). Server details will be provided by the AAF once deployment to the test federation is completed.

Documentation for developers wishing to use IdE support for the Shibboleth [Simple Aggregation](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPAttributeResolver#NativeSPAttributeResolver-SimpleAggregationAttributeResolver) profile will be provided by the AAF once deployment to the test federation is completed.

Example applications in Ruby have been made available for each of these approaches:

* [Example application for integration via Rapid Connect + IdE RESTful API][rapid-example]
* [Example application for integration via a Shibboleth SP][sp-example]
